        <h1>Chances Guide to Profitable Betting </h1>
        <h2> One way to be profitable in sports betting is with +EV betting</h2>
        <p> +EV betting is where you place a bet where the odds are in your favor. Lets say, just for example, Alabama Crimson Tide is
            playing a high school football team. The odds would favor Alabama by far. Alabama would be -10000 favorites and the
            high school team would be +10000. Lets say those are fair odds. If draftkings accidently put -1000 for the odds on alabama
            then that would be a +EV bet.
        </p>

        <h3>Long term</h3>
        <p>+EV betting is a long term strategy. Let me explain. Let's say we will flip a coin with a 50% chance of heads and a 50% 
            chance of tails. If it lands heads I will give you +120 of your bet or x1.2 and if it lands tails ill give you +100 of your
            bet or x1. If we flip the coin just ten times there is a chance I win money but if we flip it 1000 times, then most likely
            you will be in the green because you will ahve reduced the amount of varience.
