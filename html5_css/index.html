            <h3>What is EV betting?</h3>
                <p1>    I am gonna use a coin to explain it. A coin has two sides, heads and tails. If I flip a coin it has a 50% chance of
                landing on either side. Let's say we bet and if it lands on heads you win $2. If it lands on tails you lose $1. With 
                those bet odds you have a 50% chance to win $2>>on average thats $1 gained and a 50% chance to lose $1>>on average 
                thats 50c lost. So, $1 - 50c = .50c in Expected Value each bet.</p1>

                <h3>How do you find +EV bets?</h3>
                    <p2>    You want to find bets where the bet odds don't match the true probabilities of said bet. A common way to do it 
                    is by comparing the book your betting on to a much sharper sportsbook. Another way is by comparing the bet to 
                    the markets average odds. As you can see from the picture 5 different sportsbooks are around -215 odds for 
                    Christasha McNeil to win the tennis match. Fanduel has the odds of -115 available. This would be considered a 
                    +EV bet.</p2>
